        "info": "<p>Embroidery is the process of using thread to stitch a design or logo onto a product. It’s commonly used to adorn polos, coats, and hats with logos or graphics. Rather than sewing a design by hand, a digital file is now developed that instructs a machine on how and where to place each stitch. Embroidery works best with logos or artwork that are simple and have a low color count. Embroidery is usually not possible for photographs and artwork with great detail or small typography. If this is the case, we’ll get in touch with you and discuss ways to change your design or advise other options.</p><p>Embroidery is recommended for larger orders as digitizing the artwork is a time consuming process.</p>"

        "info": "<p>When you think about t-shirt printing, you typically think of screen printing. Each color of a design is separated and burned to individual fine-mesh screens in this classic t-shirt printing procedure. Through the screen, the ink is subsequently transferred to the garment. Screen printing is commonly chosen by teams, organizations, and enterprises because it is incredibly cost-effective for printing large bespoke apparel orders.</p><p>Screen printing is ideal for large orders, one-of-a-kind products, prints that require bright or speciality inks, or color matching Pantone values. There are less restrictions on what objects and materials can be printed on using screen printing. Because of the short turnaround periods, it can be a very cost-effective choice for large orders. However, because of the time-consuming preparation, small runs might be costly.</p>"

        "info": "<p>Printing a computer image directly onto a shirt or object is known as digital printing or Direct-To-Garment (DTG). It’s a newer technology that works similarly to your inkjet printer at home. To generate the colors in your design, special CMYK inks are blended. As a result, there is no limit to the number of colors you can use in your design. As a result, digital printing is an excellent choice for printing photographs and other detailed<em> </em>artwork.</p><p>Traditional screen printing has a higher cost per print. Digital printing, on the other hand, is far more cost effective for smaller orders since it avoids the hefty setup expenses of screen printing (or even a single shirt).</p>"
